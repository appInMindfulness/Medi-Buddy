# Medi-Buddy
This is the repository for the Application in Mindfulness Project Group for CSC450, Fall 2015

Our project is to create a web-based user experience where the user is taught Buddhist mindfulness techniques through a series of guided meditation modules. These modules will teach the user about different aspects of meditation such as breathing, concentration, and focus. The user will be prompted throughout to ensure understanding of the techniques explored. For example a balloon like object will display on the screen, increasing and decreasing in size to demonstrate how to breathe for mediation. Each training session will be longer than the previous and will have a chime to indicate when the session is finished.  At the completion of each session, the user will be prompted with survey questions to understand how he or she is progressing. The web application will be hooked into a database that stores user data. All the survey data will be stored in this database so that the researchers will be able to view the survey results. There will be a researcher view that allows researchers to add new study participants as well as aggregate their data as part of the researchers overall study.
